//The uvm_sequence_base class
/*
1.class declaration:-
   1.class uvm_sequence_base extends uvm_sequence_item
   2.virtual class uvm_sequence #(type REQ = uvm_sequence_item,type RSP = REQ) extends uvm_sequence_base
2.Methods:-
  1.function new (string name="uvm_sequence") -> The constructor for uvm_sequence_base.
3.sequence execution methods:-
  1.virtual task start (uvm_sequencer_base  sequencer,uvm_sequence_base  parent_sequence=null,int  this_priority=-1,bit call_pre_post=1)
    1.this method is used to execute sequence
    2.the sequencer arguments tells on which sequencer the sequence to be run
    3.If parent_sequence is null, then this sequence is a root parent, otherwise it is a child of parent_sequence.
      The parent_sequenceâ€™s pre_do, mid_do, and post_do methods will be called during the execution of this sequence
    4.By default, the priority of a sequence is the priority of its parent sequence.  If it is a root sequence, its default priority is 100.A different priority may be specified by this_priority.  Higher numbers indicate higher priority.
    5.If call_pre_post is set to 1 (default), then the pre_body and post_body tasks will be called before and after the sequence body is called.
